# Streamer Card Environment Configuration Template
# ====================================================================
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (e.g., `cp .env.example .env`)
# 2. Adjust the values below to match your desired configuration.
#

# -- General Settings --

# Node.js environment. Always use 'production' for better performance.
NODE_ENV=production

# -- Docker Image & Container Naming --

# The name for the Docker image that will be built.
IMAGE_NAME=streamer-card-app

# The name for the running Docker container.
CONTAINER_NAME=streamer-card-container

# -- Performance & Resource Tuning --

# Enable low-spec mode. Reduces resource usage significantly. (true/false)
# Recommended for servers with < 2GB RAM.
LOW_SPEC_MODE=false

# Final image resolution scale factor. Higher values produce sharper images but require more CPU/RAM.
# Example: 1 for low-spec, 2 for standard, 2.5+ for high-res.
IMAGE_SCALE=2

# Maximum number of concurrent Puppeteer instances. Higher values improve throughput but require more CPU/RAM.
# Example: 1 for low-spec, 2-5 for standard, 10+ for high-performance.
MAX_CONCURRENCY=5

# Number of times to retry a failed request.
MAX_RETRIES=2

# -- Timeout Settings (in milliseconds) --

# Puppeteer's internal protocol timeout. Increase if you see timeout errors during complex operations.
# Default: 60000 (60s). For low-spec, 120000 (120s) might be needed.
PROTOCOL_TIMEOUT=60000

# Page navigation timeout. Increase if the target page loads slowly.
# Default: 120000 (120s). For low-spec, 90000 (90s) is a safe value.
NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT=120000

# Screenshot generation timeout. Increase for very large or complex cards.
# Default: 60000 (60s).
SCREENSHOT_TIMEOUT=60000
